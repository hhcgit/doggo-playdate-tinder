# Contribution Guide

Please refer to this guide when contributing. In general, we will follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

## Initial Set Up

You will only need to complete these steps once.

1. Fork the repo on GitHub
   ![The fork button can be found at the top right of the project repo page.](https://i.imgur.com/bO74UWY.png)
2. Clone your forked project to your own machine
3. Enter the repository and install its dependencies
   ```
   $ cd doggo-playdate-tinder && npm i
   ```
4. Create your own branch!
   ```
   $ git pull origin master    // ensures you have the most recent version of the project
   $ git checkout -b initialize-client
   $ git push origin initialize-client
   ```

## Contribute

Every time you prepare to push your work, you will follow these steps.

5. Code, code, code away to your heart's content-- ON YOUR BRANCH.
6. Check you're on your branch! Commit changes to your own branch. First, track any files you might have added. Then, commit with a short description of the work you did. An example below:
   ```
   $ git branch
   * initialize-client
     master
   $ git add .
   $ git commit -m 'initialized client react application, using CRA boilerplate configuration. added styled-components, eslint, airbnb style guide, and prettier configuration'
   ```
7. Push your work back up to branch on your fork.

   ```
   $ git push initialize-client
   ```

8. Submit a pull request so that we can review your changes

   NOTE: Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!
